# nn-art-epoch-assignment

## Description
 'nn-art-epoch-assignment' is a deep learning project that aims to classify images of art into their respective art epochs, including Baroque, Renaissance, Modern, etc. The project involves the use of state-of-the-art deep neural networks, as well as various image preprocessing techniques, to create a highly accurate system for assigning art images to their correct epochs.

## Features
* Image Download: The system can automatically download art images from various sources, including online art collections and public domain repositories.
* Image Preprocessing: ArtEpochNet uses advanced image preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality, remove noise, and normalize image features.
* Custom Neural Network: The project includes a custom deep neural network architecture designed specifically for the task of art epoch classification.
* Model Training: ArtEpochNet uses large-scale datasets to train and optimize the custom neural network.
* Evaluation Metrics: The system is evaluated using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.
